it2moai.py, version 0.3
----------------------

Python 3 only.

Use the example.it or .mptm file to do your song. When done, run this 
script and it will generate an output.moai file usable by 
thirtydollar.website.

Don't change the samples/instruments (.mptm instrument Alternative Tuning may be changed).
Only notes and volume settings are parsed. Commands are not parsed except for EFx/FFx/EEx/EFx in rows containing notes (for detuning)
Note Cuts ^ will cut all sounds, no matter where they are placed (i.e., be careful with these)

Initial settings:
Initial Tempo: adjustable
Ticks/Row: 3 (fixed, do not change)
Initial Global Vol: adjustable (template set at 60)
Sample Volume: 160 (this may be adjusted but does not affect the output, it is set so that tracker output during playback sounds closer to Moai website output)

Version history
---------------

* 0.1: Initial creation of program by kleeder
* 0.2: Added global volume initial setting, note volumes, and updated the soundlist to incorporate the 
       current available sounds (list grows from 131 samples to 191). Samples tuned in example module 
       and appropriate offsets added to the soundlist. Adjusted global/sample volume defaults so that
       tracker playback volume sounds closer to moai playback volume.
* 0.3: Module name is no longer hardcoded and must instead be typed in. Output name remains as is.
       Added ability to xenharmonise files during moai conversion to any tone equal temperament tuning
       system. This may be handy for .mptm files with such a tuning.
* 0.4: Support added for Fine/Extra Fine Portamento Down/Up commands (EFx/FFx/EEx/FEx) to detune notes.
       Use only on rows that also contain a note, otherwise the script will break.
* 0.5: Fixed errors on non-existent patterns and notes
